Getting an Account
==================

Before you can start using the clusters you must first request HPC access.

For Staff
^^^^^^^^^

HPC access is made available for staff by email requests made to `l.quayle@shu.ac.uk <mailto:l.quayle@shu.ac.uk>`_ or `a.webster@shu.ac.uk <mailto:a.webster@shu.ac.uk>`_.

In order to gain access, you will be required to undertake a brief (15 - 30 minute) online meeting with one of the administrators to discuss your HPC needs, and then complete an online certification in Unix Shell to demonstrate basic command line competency.

For Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following categories of students can also have HPC access with the permission of their supervisors:

* Research Postgraduates
* Taught Postgraduates - for project work and only after your supervisor has discussed this with HPC admininstrators
* Final Year Undergraduates - for project work and only after your supervisor has discussed this with HPC admininstrators

In order to gain access you will need to request that your supervisor get in touch with the HPC administrators by email requests made to `l.quayle@shu.ac.uk <mailto:l.quayle@shu.ac.uk>`_ or `a.webster@shu.ac.uk <mailto:a.webster@shu.ac.uk>`_.

As for staff members, you will be required to undertake a brief (15 - 30 minute) online meeting with one of the administrators to discuss your HPC needs, and then complete an online certification in Unix Shell to demonstrate basic command line competency.

After Access Has Been Granted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have been granted HPC access, you can use your normal login credentials to connect to the clusters. 

For further details on how to connect to the clusters please read the section on :ref:`how to connect to the clusters<connecting>`. 

Conditions for HPC Access and Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The High Performance Computing service is for legitimate research only. Inappropriate use (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, personal storage misuse, unauthorised access) may lead to investigation per `Sheffield Hallam Universities IT Policies and Regulations <https://sheffieldhallam.sharepoint.com/sites/3009/policies/SitePages/Main-IT-Policies.aspx>`_.

.. important::

   You must not share your account credentials or allow others to run jobs using your account. Any misuse of accounts will be investigated in accordance with `Sheffield Hallam Universities IT Policies and Regulations <https://sheffieldhallam.sharepoint.com/sites/3009/policies/SitePages/Main-IT-Policies.aspx>`_.

As a multiple user shared system, our cluster has some additional considerations in comparison to other IT Services provided at Sheffield Hallam University. Although we have strived to ensure that a robust baseline of security is in place suitable for the HPC community, we are aware that regulatory bodies and our research partners are asking for increasingly stringent security controls that the HPC may not have in place.

.. warning::

   The High Performance Computing service should not be used to store or process sensitive information.
   For example: medical records, personal information, financial data, commercially sensitive or any other form of restricted data without first discussing your requirements with `Digital Technology Services <https://sheffieldhallam.sharepoint.com/sites/3009>`_.

Extra care should always be taken when dealing with sensitive information; if you are in any doubt about the sensitivity of information, or how it should be handled, then please contact `Digital Technology Services <https://sheffieldhallam.sharepoint.com/sites/3009>`_ for advice.
